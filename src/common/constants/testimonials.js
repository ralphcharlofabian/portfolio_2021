    testimonials:`RC is a good teammate and a great mentor. He's a team player and doesn't let anybody get left out. He's very willing to teach us and explains things in a non complicated way. As I transitioned from backend to frontend developer he was one of my mentors and he didn't make it intimidating to learn things from scratch. He guided me well and is very approachable whenever I have difficult or even basic questions. He doesn't only follow his way of coding but takes into consideration how his mentee thinks and lets them learn their way. `,
